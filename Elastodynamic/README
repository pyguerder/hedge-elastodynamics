This is a tool for simulating elastic wave propagation with Hedge.

A Python reference documentation is available in the 'html' folder.

== Directory structure ==
* html: the autogenerated reference documentation
* libraries: useful reusable functions for the program
* Materials: material (.dat) files used in the simulations
* Meshes: Gmsh mesh (.geo and .msh files used in the simulations

== Usage ==
To run the simulation, define the parameters in elastic_wave.py and run:
./rm-vis && python elastic_wave.py

To regenerate the documentation, run:
epydoc --graph=all *.py
